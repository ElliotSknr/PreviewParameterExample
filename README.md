This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Desktop.

This project demonstrates an issue with preview parameters in CMP.

See the app.kt file, the preview without parameters will render successfully, whereas the preview with parameters will
fail to render. You may first need to comment out the problematic preview to get the working 
preview to initially render.
